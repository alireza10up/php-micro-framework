## 10up microFramework

### Running the Project

1. **Copy or rename the `.envExample` file to `.env`:** This step ensures that you have a file named `.env` where you
   can set your custom configuration values.
2. **Set your configuration in the `.env` file:** Replace the default values in the `.env` file with your own
   configuration settings. Refer to the documentation for specific instructions on which configurations are required and
   optional.
3. **Run the project:** Once you've configured the `.env` file, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  php 10up serve
```
